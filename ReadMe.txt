Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this file. 

For compatability, I reccomend utilising VS2019.

To get the program to start, Load into the file and open main.cpp

go to AdvancedOpenGLRender in the Solution Explorer and right click. 

	Press Properties

	VC++ Directories

	Set the "Include Directories" tab to fit the AdvancedOpenGLRenderer\Libraries\include

	Set the "Libary Directories tab to fit AdvancedOpenGLRenderer\Libraries\lib
